            <p>A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to function. A developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such a way that end users have no difficulty navigating the site. The website should not be so simple that it does not appeal to advanced users, nor should it be so complicated that the beginner is easily lost in the process.</p>

                            <p>This article is meant to serve as a practical guide to becoming a professional web developer. I’ve spent over 20 years writing code for the web. I work with and help developers daily. In this article, I will tell you what you should learn, when you should learn it, and where you can learn it from (usually for free). I’ll then give you advice on how to get real world experience and, most importantly, how to get paid for writing code</p>
